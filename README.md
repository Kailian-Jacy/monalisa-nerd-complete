# Nerd Font Complete

Despite installation of so-called nerd-font, some icon breaks. That's because some subsets of nerdfont are not included.

This is a `--complete` version of `monolisa` font. Details refer to: *https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-patcher*

# Original fonts

```bash
ls | grep -v Nerd
```

# Nerd-Completed

```bash
ls | grep Nerd
```
